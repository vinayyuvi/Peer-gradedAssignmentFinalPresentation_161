# Peer-graded-Assignment-Final-Project-Submission<br>
The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others.For this project you must submit:<br>
1.  A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.<br>
2.  A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter (https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations) pitching your algorithm and app as if you were presenting to your boss or an investor.<br>

Review criteria<br>

Data Product<br>
1.  Does the link lead to a Shiny app with a text input box that is running on shinyapps.io?<br>
2.  Does the app load to the point where it can accept input?<br>
3.  When you type a phrase in the input box do you get a prediction of a single word after pressing submit and/or a suitable delay for the model to compute the answer?<br>
4.  Put five phrases drawn from Twitter or news articles in English leaving out the last word. Did it give a prediction for every one?<br>

Slide Deck<br>
1.  Does the link lead to a 5 slide deck on R Pubs?<br>
2.  Does the slide deck contain a description of the algorithm used to make the prediction?<br>
3.  Does the slide deck describe the app, give instructions, and describe how it functions?<br>
4.  How would you describe the experience of using this app?<br>
5.  Does the app present a novel approach and/or is particularly well done?<br>
6.  Would you hire this person for your own data science startup company?<br>
